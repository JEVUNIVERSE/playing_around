I began my journey exploring front-end development,
which led me to craft a portfolio webpage. Within this webpage, 
I embarked on an endeavor to construct an online restaurant experience under the HOME section,
employing HTML and CSS. The process was both enjoyable and instructive,
prompting me to christen the project "Playing Around" - a fitting title reflective of the delight derived from its creation.
